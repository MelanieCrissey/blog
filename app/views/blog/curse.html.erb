	<h2>Like a Sailor</h2>

<p>Yesterday I overheard a conversation at my office that went something like this:</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>MAN: The lady who ran the event was very unprofessional. From the moment she got on stage she began dropping the f-bomb and it just didn’t stop.</p>

		<p>BRO: I don’t like it when women curse. A few well-timed f-bombs here and there can be alright, but when women curse? What a turn-off!</p>
		</div>

	<p>Gross, bro. Whether or not I choose to use expletives has nothing to do with satisfying your expectations or preferences for attraction.</p>

	<p>I have notoriously deplorable language habits.</p>

	<p>Lately I’ve been working to clean up my act, but my husband still battles my propensity for profanity when we’re together in public.</p>

	<p style="font-family: source-serif-pro, serif; font-weight: bold; border: 3px solid #333; padding: 10px;">“Hey - I know you’re reclaiming that word, but could you pipe down? We’re in <i>a neighborhood</i>.”</p>

	<p>Some good reasons to curse:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="bullet">To relieve stress or tension when something bad happens</li>
			<li class="bullet">To express solidarity or membership in a group</li>
			<li class="bullet">To make someone laugh</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Some good reasons to avoid cursing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="bullet">To show respect</li>
			<li class="bullet">To practice self-control</li>
			<li class="bullet"><strike>To seem ladylike so that men will approve of you</strike>  LOL NOPE</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Please know that if I ever decide to start censoring my language, I’ll be doing it for selfish reasons.
