	<p>Yesterday I overheard a conversation at my office that went something like this:</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>MAN: The lady who ran the event was very unprofessional. From the moment she got on stage she began dropping the f-bomb and it just didn’t stop.</p>

		<p>BRO: I don’t like it when women curse. A few well-timed f-bombs here and there can be alright, but when women curse? What a turn-off!</p>
		</div>

	<p>Gross, bro. Whether or not I choose to use expletives has nothing to do with satisfying expectations or preferences for attraction.</p>

	<p>I have notoriously deplorable language habits.</p>

	<p>Lately I’ve been working to clean up my act, but my husband still battles my propensity for profanity when we’re together in public.</p> 

	<p>“Hey - I know you’re reclaiming that word, but could you pipe down? We’re in <i>a neighborhood</i>.”</p>

	<p>Some good reasons to curse:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="bullet">To relieve stress or tension when something bad happens</li>
			<li class="bullet">To express solidarity or membership in a group</li>
			<li class="bullet">To make someone laugh</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Some good reasons to avoid cursing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="bullet">To show respect</li>
			<li class="bullet">To practice self-control</li>
			<li class="bullet"><strike>To seem ladylike so that men will approve of you</strike>  LOL NOPE</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Please know that if I ever decide to start censoring my language, I’ll be doing it for selfish reasons.

	<b>Do what you love:</b> the ubiquitous mantra of start-up land.
	</p>
	<p>
 This morning one of my favorite people in the world posted this comment on social media:
 </p>

<img class="centerly" src="/assets/lifeistooshort.jpg"/>

<p>At first I was like: </p>

<img src="/assets/Preach.gif"/>

<p>Then I remembered that a writer for Slate made a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/01/do_what_you_love_love_what_you_do_an_omnipresent_mantra_that_s_bad_for_work.html">compelling case</a> that this mentality devalues labor.</p>

<p>Honest talk: I feel remarkably lucky and grateful that I love what I do, love where I work, and also love the people with whom I work. <b>Do what you love</b> is not my mantra.<p>

<p>My mantra? <b>Don’t do anything you don’t want to do.</b></p>

<p>If a task is not important and you don’t want to do it, don't. If the task is important enough that it <i>needs</i> to get done, it’s probably part of something greater that you genuinely want to do.</p>

<p>Case in point: I <i>loathe</i> Chaturanga Dandasana.<p> 

<img class="center" src="/assets/trex.jpg"/>

<p>I’ve never had great upper body strength. (Monkey bars? Forget about it). Hovering over the ground with my arms bent is uncomfortable. My mind starts racing, “Are my arms bent enough? How long do I have to stay here?”</p>

<p>But, I <i>love</i> <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/928">sun salutations</a>. I love how powerful and peaceful I feel when I’ve made it through a sequence. When I remember that chaturanga is part of the sun salutation - just a stop on the way to the rest of the joy - then I acknowledge that I truly, deeply want to chaturanga.</p>

<p>Even if we don’t have the luxury of doing what we love 100% of the time, we can decide to love what we do - if it’s worth it.</p>

	<p class="date">23 May 2014

	Yesterday Tavi Gevinson posted a snippet of text on Instagram:</p>

	<iframe class="frame" src="//instagram.com/p/oTgYzHG_Qc/embed/" width="100%" height="710px"frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>My reaction: “Whoa. If women only feel confident when they’re practically perfect, most women must <i>never</i> feel truly confident. Maybe Mary Poppins. The rest of us are doomed.”</p>

<img src="/assets/practicallyperfect.jpg"/>

<p>Tavi’s caption: “This is why I start every morning with M.I.A <img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src="/assets/gold-star.png"/>"</p>

<img src="/assets/bad-girls.jpg"/> 

<p>(Excuse me while I add all the M.I.A. songs to my <i><a target="_blank" href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1216657104/playlist/3gB0VbAyNg02B62tLw8pyE">Do Work</a></i> playlist.)</p>

<p>The pictured excerpt is a bit of an article titled <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/" />The Confidence Gap</a></i> that was published in The Atlantic last month. Key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li class="bullet"><b>Don't fake confidence.</b> People react positively to genuine overconfidence and negatively to insincere displays of confidence.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Don't seek perfection.</b> Perfectionism breeds inaction. I quote Queen Bey, “Perfection is a disease of a nation.”</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Don't blame yourself.</b> External attribution (“That test was hard!”) makes us resilient, while internal attribution (“I’m so bad at taking tests.”) holds us back.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Ladies: Speak less.</b> Both men and women perceive female <a target="_blank" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/volubility">volubility</a> as a sign of weakness, while expecting successful men to speak more.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Do more.</b> We build genuine confidence through successes and failures. Stop overthinking things and just do something.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Speak less” is challenging advice. It's also the last thing you want to hear when you’ve finally worked up the courage to do something… <i>like</i>… <i>I don’t know</i>… <b>start blogging.</b></p>

<p>Henceforth I pledge brevity. Here’s to making every word count.</p>

<p>Cheers, y'all!</p>
