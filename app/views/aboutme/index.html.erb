			Hi, I'm Melanie. I love learning new things and writing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I live in a swell Southern town with my <a href="http://alancrissey.com/about">man-friend</a> and two sweet, old dogs.
		</p>
		<p>
			My friends and I founded the <a href="http://mariettatribune.com/">Marietta Tribune</a> to promote people and businesses in our neighborhood.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy good food, good music, and good company. I like my wine dry, my whiskey neat, and my beer bitter.
		</p>
		<p>
			My mother named me after a pale-faced, mealy-mouted ninny, but I think of myself as a culturally-Baptist, feminist-idealist human being.
