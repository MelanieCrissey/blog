	<h2>Confidence in me</h2>
	<h3>Oh help</h3>

	Earlier today Tavi Gevinson posted a snippet of text on Instagram. The summary of the excerpt: “Women feel confident only when they’re perfect. Or practically perfect.”</p>

<p>My gut reaction: “Whoa. If women only feel confident when they’re practically perfect, most women must never feel truly confident. Maybe Mary Poppins. The rest of us are doomed.”</p>

<p>Tavi’s caption: “This is why I start every morning with M.I.A (gold star!)” (Excuse me while I add all the M.I.A. songs to my <i>Do Work</i> playlist.)</p>

<p>The pictured excerpt is a bit of an article titled The Confidence Gap that was published in the Atlantic last month. Key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li class="bullet"><b>Do not fake confidence.</b> People react positively to genuine overconfidence and negatively to insincere displays of confidence.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Do not seek perfection.</b> Perfectionism breeds inaction. I quote Queen Bey, “Perfection is a disease of a nation.”</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Do not blame yourself.</b> External attribution (“That test was hard!”) makes us resilient, while internal attribution (“I’m so bad at taking tests.”) holds us back.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Ladies: Speak less.</b> Both men and women perceive female volubility as a sign of weakness, while expecting successful men to speak more.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Do more.</b> We accumulate genuine confidence through work, success, and failure. Stop overthinking things and just do something.</li>
</ul>

<p>These takeaways are challenging. I feel threatened by the notion that both women and men agree that women who speak less than others seem more competent. When it comes to my time to talk, should I sacrifice equal treatment in pursuit of equal opportunity for success?</p>

<p>It’s tricky. Sometimes my thoughts come out completely unfiltered, uncensored, and I lay awake at night thinking, “Next time think before you open your big mouth, ya big oaf.” Other times I feel like I need to dip everything I say in sugar before I say it - not because it’s my natural communication style, but because I need to meet certain expectations about how Southern ladies speak.</p>

<p>When I make a choice to be concise, people say I seem blunt. I end up apologizing and re-explaining my point with the subtext, “I’m sorry. Please don’t think I’m a bitch. I have an opinion about something and I thought I could share it with you without going into detail about alternative ideas I explored and emotions I experienced before I decided on this one thing.”</p>

<p>“Speak less” is also the last thing you want to hear when you’ve finally worked up the courage to do something… like… I don’t know… start blogging.</p>

<p>So, here’s to making every word count. Cheers, y'all.</p>
