	<h2>Confidence in me</h2>
	<h3>Oh, help</h3>

	Yesterday Tavi Gevinson posted a snippet of text on Instagram. The summary of the excerpt: “Women feel confident only when they’re perfect. Or practically perfect.”</p>

<p>My gut reaction: “Whoa. If women only feel confident when they’re practically perfect, most women must never feel truly confident. Maybe Mary Poppins. The rest of us are doomed.”</p>

<p>Tavi’s caption: “This is why I start every morning with M.I.A (gold star!)” (Excuse me while I add all the M.I.A. songs to my <i>Do Work</i> playlist.)</p>

<p>The pictured excerpt is a bit of an article titled <i>The Confidence Gap</i> that was published in The Atlantic last month. Key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li class="bullet"><b>Don't fake confidence.</b> People react positively to genuine overconfidence and negatively to insincere displays of confidence.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Don't seek perfection.</b> Perfectionism breeds inaction. I quote Queen Bey, “Perfection is a disease of a nation.”</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Don't blame yourself.</b> External attribution (“That test was hard!”) makes us resilient, while internal attribution (“I’m so bad at taking tests.”) holds us back.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Ladies: Speak less.</b> Both men and women perceive female volubility as a sign of weakness, while expecting successful men to speak more.</li>
<li class="bullet"><b>Do more.</b> We build genuine confidence through successes and failures. Stop overthinking things and just do something.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Speak less” is challenging advice. It's also the last thing you want to hear when you’ve finally worked up the courage to do something… <i>like</i>… <i>I don’t know</i>… <b>start blogging.</b></p>

<p>Henceforth I pledge brevity. Here’s to making every word count.</p>

<p>Cheers, y'all!</p>
